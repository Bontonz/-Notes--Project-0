# -Notes--Project-0
<p>I used Scratchpad to create these 
notes. I hope this is what you are 
looking for.

<a>HTML is made up of text content, markup, 
referencees to other documents and links 
to other pages.
<br> </a>< > = opening tag <br> < /> = 
closing tag <br> <b>BOLD</b> <br> <em> 
Italics </em>  <br> <a></a>I can pretty 
much create an entire document in <em>italics</em>
or <b>bold</b> if I want. 
 </a> <b> I can even do it all in 
BOLD!</b> 
<br> 

<br>

<a href>If I want to link to a webpage I use 
 ""www.yahoo.com" </a>

<p>1. A web page is a text document written in HTML.</p>
<p> 2. Coding works by writing text in a 
language that the computer can understand,
like I am doing right now, </p>
<p>3. Computers are stupid- they only know
what they tell them to know. </p>
<p>4. Programmers cant and wont remember
everything, when in doubt, look it up. </p>
<p>5. An HTML tag is the language between
brackets that tell the computer what to do.
 An Element is what is contained within 
 the brackets. An attribute is used to 
 to another page or website. </p>
